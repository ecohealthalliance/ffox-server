 variables:
   # When using dind service we need to instruct docker, to talk with the
   # daemon started inside of the service. The daemon is available with
   # a network connection instead of the default /var/run/docker.sock socket.
   #
   # The 'docker' hostname is the alias of the service container as described at
   # https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html#accessing-the-services
   #
   # Note that if you're using Kubernetes executor, the variable should be set to
   # tcp://localhost:2375 because of how Kubernetes executor connects services
   # to the job container
   DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375/
   # When using dind, it's wise to use the overlayfs driver for
   # improved performance.
   DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
